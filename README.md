## Purpose
In computer science class, me and Max [https://github.com/Maxwell-Adams] were bored learning Java recursion and decided to try to make an evolution simulator using python. (Note: notice in this github there is only a javascript version, I hand transfered all the code to javascript in under half an hour, yes im the javascript G.O.A.T)
